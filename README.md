# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors AI – FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning Project

This project implements an intelligent **Rock–Paper–Scissors** player designed to compete against several built-in strategies (`Quincy`, `Abbey`, `Kris`, and `Mrugesh`) from the [FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-projects/rock-paper-scissors).

## 🧠 Overview

The goal of the project is to create a `player()` function that can **adapt and win** against multiple opponents by predicting their next moves based on their previous patterns and behaviors.

Each opponent follows a specific algorithmic strategy, and the objective is to develop an approach that consistently beats all of them in 1000 rounds.
